I give back to society by being a Youth Corp Leader â€“ By Youth Corps Singapore under the National Youth Council. I was the Project Lead for Project Eco-Echo which focuses on educating children on environmental protection in collaboration with National Environmental Agency (NEA) Singapore. It has been a really fruitful experience learning, working and collaborating with the various beneficiaries as well as government partners.
