During my school term, I realized that there were underused lockers in the school's common room where students usually study, play and relax in the area. I wrote a proposal to the school to set up an initiative where students can "rent" these lockers and sell various products and items in school.

I was also able to secure funding and grants from the school to hire students under the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to look after the room during school hours.
