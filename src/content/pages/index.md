Making the world a better place is important personally. 

I believe that entrepreneurship and innovation is one way to effect this change, inspired by technology enhancing efficiency, increasing utilization for under-used assets, and reducing carbon footprint. Companies like Grab, AirBnB, Tesla, and SpaceX are my role models in catalysing positive changes, whose forward-thinking founders goes against the grain building amazing products, solving issues that were thought impossible.
