I took up Integrated Multidisciplinary Project (IMP) in my final year where I worked together with students from various faculties to develop a product on a real world application over the span of 3 months. We developed "ROLLEY" a trolley that identifies and follows the user using integrated sensors for obstacle detection and navigation.

We were also selected to Exhibit our Product in the Maker Faire Singapore 2017 at the Singapore Science Centre. During the Exhibition, our team received many good feedbacks and also managed to secure an implementation project with an industry partner!
