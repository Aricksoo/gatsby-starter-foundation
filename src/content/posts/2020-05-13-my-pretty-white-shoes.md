Received the president certificate for my term of service from October 2016 to 2017. Being a student leader taught me many valuable lessons, from greater responsibility, to time-management and even people management. 

Throughout the term, I spearhead the Involvement of the diploma student body, organizing social work and team-building activities as well as to prepare students on portfolio-building through various workshops and competitions. 

Aside from organizing the school annual events, I was selected to form a team with all the schools in NYP to plan and execute the freshman welcoming party along with commemorating NYP 25th Anniversary. We also managed important stakeholders and invited many reputable artists such as Benjamin Kheng, DJ Tinc and the Twins Gone Wrong.

My journey in serving the diploma student body has not been an easy task but a very fulfilling one, from organizing mentorship for freshman to integrate smoothly into the learning curve, to even creating the Yearbook for Graduating Cohorts. Looking at the experiences gained and memories made, makes it worthwhile. I'm glad to have served as the President.
