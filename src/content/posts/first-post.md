Through the various projects and volunteering, I realized that volunteering services is just one of the ways we could impact them. Hence, during my holidays, I applied my knowledge and skills from my diploma and along with the guidance of my lecturer lead me to help assist in creating a affordable and portable table for an elderly home at Bright Hill Evergreen Home for volunteers to facilitate having the elderly out to have their meals instead of having them in the vicinity all the time. 

I utilized softwares such as AutoCAD to design a mount and a clamp, strong enough to hold a flat piece of acrylic while the elderly is resting their arms. It is also important that the acrylic can be easily be removed and kept when not in use. I then 3D printed the mount and clamp using the Makerspace in my school and attached into a wheelchair.

Looking at how I could make people's day through the development of products inspired me to continue innovating solutions in search of everyday problems.
