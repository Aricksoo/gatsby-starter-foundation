My personal Aspiration

> "To make the world a better place"

![My Polytechnic Graduation](/assets/img_6919.jpg "Graduation Photoshoot")



Being a **budding technologist**, I believe entrepreneurship and innovation is one way to effect this change, inspired by technology enhancing efficiency, increasing utilization for under-used assets, and reducing carbon footprint. Companies like [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/), [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com.sg/), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), and [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) are my role models in catalysing positive changes, whose forward-thinking founders goes against the grain of building amazing products, solving issues that were thought impossible.

I am very passionate about bringing concepts into reality which is why I’ve not only started my own startup previously with notable awards such as the Winning Idea Exhibited at *Cool Ideas for better HDB Living*. I also immersed myself in various competitions and programs to reach my personal aspiration, to make the world a better place.\

I give back to society by being a Youth Corp Leader – By Youth Corps Singapore under the National Youth Council. Co-Founded Smart Cities Youth Network, a Non-Profit Organization that empowers youths with Smart City Concepts through cross-collaboration between Academia, Industry, and the Government to Shape the Future of Cities.

A quote that strongly resonates with me since young.

I hope one day I too will be able catalyse positive changes in the world.
