My Personal Aspiration:

> **"To make the world a better place."**

It started from my journey at Nanyang Polytechnic, pursuing the Diploma of Engineering with Business. I was involved in various multi-disciplinary projects, creating innovative inventions that would impact society. Having gone through all these experiences made me grew into Technology Entrepreneurship as I believe of solutions in search of problems by sustaining technology efforts, being persistent, and through coordinated endeavor, I strongly believe we can accomplish technological change.

I'm continuously building my skillset to make the world a better place, which is why I chose to further my studies at Smart City Management and Technology Major in Singapore Management University (SMU) to equip myself with the knowledge of utilizing technology to make a positive impact to the lives of people, businesses and the environment.

Being a **budding technologist**, I believe entrepreneurship and innovation is one way to effect this change, inspired by technology enhancing efficiency, increasing utilization for under-used assets, and reducing carbon footprint. Companies like [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/), [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com.sg/), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), and [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) are my role models in catalysing positive changes, whose forward-thinking founders goes against the grain of building amazing products, solving issues that were thought impossible.

I am very passionate about bringing concepts into reality which is why I’ve not only started my own startup previously with notable awards such as the Winning Idea Exhibited at *Cool Ideas for Better HDB Living*. I also immersed myself in various competitions and programs to reach my personal aspiration, to make the world a better place.\

In my free time, I give back to society by being a Youth Corp Leader – By Youth Corps Singapore under the National Youth Council. I further co-founded Smart Cities Youth Network, a Social Enterprise that empowers youths with Smart City concepts through cross-collaboration between Academia, Industry, and the Government to Shape the Future of Cities.

I believe that everyone can achieve great things when they put their heart and soul into it. This quote has strongly resonated with me since young.

> “There is not great people in the world, only great challenges which ordinary people rise to meet.”

I hope one day, I too will be able to catalyze positive changes in the world.
