To build thriving and sustainable communities, it is important to view what are the basic needs of the people in the community. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the most crucial needs are the physiological needs and safety needs. Our team narrowed down that to allow a community to truly flourish, we must be able to fulfill the basic needs of food, water and education of the people in the community. The issue of food insecurity can be seen from Singapore Management University (SMU) Lien Centre for Social Innovation’s study in December 2019 where about one in 10 Singaporeans struggled to get sufficient, safe and nutritious food at least once in the last 12 months.

In the report on Sharing Initiatives and Sharing Landscape in Singapore published by Institute of Policy Studies in 2019, the existing barriers to successful sharing landscape in Singapore is low public awareness, cultural issues and bureaucracy across agencies. The same barriers also apply to the sharing of food, water and education in Singapore. The needy, suffering from food insecurity, often lack the knowledge of receiving aid from the right organisations and the knowledge of nutrition, worsening their already malnourished diet. 

Even though there are already many food assistance programmes in place such as Family LifeAid by Singapore RedCross, The Food Bank and Food from the Heart, there are still many vulnerable groups that fell beyond the radar of these food assistance groups such as low income families that have many children. Other problems of current food assistance programmes also include duplication where agencies do not coordinate with one another to donate the appropriate amount of food per household.

Duplication also leads to several problems such as food wastage and expiration or food not being catered to the needy dietary needs. Due to the low public awareness of sharing, this also causes unsuitable food donations where the consumables are often expired or inappropriate for the needy.

Solution Introduction

To connect the needy, volunteers and organisations providing aid in Singapore, we propose to have a platform that has two main features: geospatial visualisation and integrated agency information. 

Firstly, we will have a geospatial visualisation plot of the nearest non-profit organisation, non-governmental organisations, charities or social enterprises, where both volunteers and the needy are able to view. Through this geospatial plot, both the volunteers and needy will be able to find an organisation that they can volunteer with or seek help from. Volunteers can filter the organisations based on their neighbourhood or based on the cause that they want to volunteer for. Similarly, the needy can also seek help from organisations based on their needs or their neighbourhood.

Secondly, other than a geographical plot of the locations of organisations, our platform will also allow the user to view information about the organization. Information provided by our platform will differ based on the nature of the organisation. For instance, if it is a food shelter, it will provide the current inventory levels, so that volunteers can choose to donate their food items to places where the inventory is low and the needy can choose to obtain food from places with higher inventory levels. For organisations that have manpower needs, our platform will be able to reflect whether or not the organisation is in need of volunteers for their initiatives.
