My time spent in Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) pursuing the Diploma in Engineering with Business (DEB) was indeed a fruitful one, I recall learning in a new environment, making new friends or even speaking and presenting in class for the first time.. All of which shaped me to who I am today. This post will sum up my experiences and journey during my time spent in NYP. Although I was the stand-by Valedictorian, the speech that I prepared still stay close to my heart even today. 

Valedictorian Speech:

"Isn't it remarkable? I think I speak for most of us when I say that those 3 years went by faster than we could ever have imagined. I remember being a freshman and thinking about how long polytechnic would be. All of those nights we spent cramming for the tests, all of the projects we've done, all of the friendships/relationships we began, ended, and mended, and all of the wonderful and terrible experiences we have had throughout have led up to this day that we never thought would come so fast. Looking back, in the blink of an eye, here I am, graduated with my diploma certificate. 

To my family, thank you for your patient understanding and for supporting me in more ways than can be counted. When I was preoccupied with my work and activities, you made sure I am well fed and clothed for school, You even had to drag me out of bed each morning or drive me to school yourself. Dear family, your constant encouragement and care have eased the challenging moments in my journey. 

Thank you Friends, you are always there for each other, supporting one another through the different hurdles in both our school as well as in our personal growth. Thank you for constantly reminding us that we are braver than we believe, stronger than we seem, smarter than we think and definitely loved more than we know. My friends, You are one of the reasons why we look forward to school the most. 

We now stand at the starting line of a new phase in life although we have said our goodbyes as we venture forth to our next milestone but let us always remember the wonderful moments and memories we shared throughout. Goodbyes aren’t forever, goodbyes are not the end. It simply means I’ll miss you till we meet again. Thank you!"

As a Student Leader, I was also tasked to choreograph and create the NYP SEG Graduation 2018 Video for the School of Engineering, I hope that my peers had enjoyed the video and reminisce about the great experience they have had in their journey.
