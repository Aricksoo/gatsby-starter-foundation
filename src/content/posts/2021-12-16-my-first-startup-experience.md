My first startup experience emerged from a competition called "Cool Ideas for Better HDB Living". In the recent trend and uptake from rising fire breakouts especially from Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs). I developed a fire safety device that uses sensors to detect and prevent devices from overheating. I also managed to achieve a $5,000 pre-seed grant to further develop the product. After the competition, I further went to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to be used for a potential pilot project at Montfort Care and to integrate and collaborate with iCity from SMU on their ShineSeniors Initiative.

In 2020, I've also created opportunity for NYP Students to do their Final Year Project (FYP) under my startup where I mentored and coach the students in their work.

Although the startup is currently inactive now, I hope I will be able to pick this up and continue in the near future.
