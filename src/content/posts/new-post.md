I give back to society by being a Youth Corp Leader â€“ By Youth Corps Singapore under the National Youth Council. I was the Project Lead for Project Eco-Echo which focuses on educating children on environmental protection in collaboration with National Environmental Agency (NEA) Singapore. It has been a really fruitful experience learning, working and collaborating with the various beneficiaries as well as government partners.

Through the various projects and volunteering, I realized that volunteering services is just one of the ways we could impact them. Hence, during my holidays, I applied my knowledge and skills from my diploma to create a affordable and portable table for an elderly home for volunteers to facilitate having the elderly out to have their meals instead of having them in the vicinity all the time.
