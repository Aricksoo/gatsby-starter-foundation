I worked together with a Multi-Disciplinary Team from different schools to develop "OSCAR" a Couse Advising Robot for NYP open house 2018. It has really been a fun experience working together and learning from different disciplines in developing the robot, the biggest fulfillment was how the students were having fun interacting with the robot!
